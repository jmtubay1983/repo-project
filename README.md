# re-simple-python-project

This project will model and simulate the effect of different biosecurity measure to within farm dynamics in livestock (i.e., poultry, swine). EMULSION will be used to model and simulate the dynamic in a poultry farm, while Netlogo will be used for a swine farm. Movement data of farmer will be used as an input in the model and other several parameters related to biosecurity. Data from farm experiments will also be used to estimate the said parameters.

## Usage

Click "Use this template" at the top of this page to create a new repository with the same folder structure.

## Project Structure

The project structure distinguishes three kinds of folders:
- read-only (RO): not edited by either code or researcher
- human-writeable (HW): edited by the researcher only.
- project-generated (PG): folders generated when running the code; these folders can be deleted or emptied and will be completely reconstituted as the project is run.
